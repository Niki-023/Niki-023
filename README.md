# Hi there, I'm Nikita 👋

I’ve always been fascinated by patterns—whether in numbers, behaviors, or the world around me. Over time, that fascination grew into a curiosity about the stories hidden in data, and how those stories can inform decisions, inspire ideas, and solve real-world problems.

My journey into **data science** began with a love for mathematics and a desire to understand how information shapes the world. What started as exploring small datasets for fun quickly evolved into a pursuit of deeper knowledge: learning Python, experimenting with machine learning algorithms, and exploring natural language processing.

I am currently pursuing a **Master’s in Computer Science**, diving into machine learning, predictive modeling, and AI applications. Beyond academics, I enjoy exploring data analytics challenges, building small projects, and turning insights into meaningful outcomes.
